In Treta Yug, before begining of his onslaught on Lanka, Rama performed Durga Puja in Autumn. This is the time of Dakhshinayana-Sun's Southward journeys and according to Puranas Goda sleep during this time. So Rama had to first wake up the Goddess Durga. On this day he began his premature awakening or Akal Bodhan of Maa Durga.

Sasthi is the sixth day of Devi Pakhsha and marked the formal biginning of Durga Puja in Bengal and other Eastern part of India four rituals-Kalparamvo (the beginning of the Pujas), Bodhan (the consecration of Ma Durga's idol), Amantran (inviting the goddess) and Adhivas (sanctifying the stay of the Goddess in the puja area of the pandals)- are performed on Sasthi. The 'Bodhon' rituals include the unveiling of the face of the idol. Bodhon,Amontron and Adibas are the important rituals of Sasthi apart from Kalparambho.
