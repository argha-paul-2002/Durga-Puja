Durga Asthami is observed in many parts of Imdia mainly in Bengal, Orissa, Jharkhand and other eastern parts of India. The day is considered significant as life is "breathed" into the idol of Durga by priests who perform elaborate rituals amidst chanting of religious verses.

The devotees of Goddess Durga start the celebrations on the morning of Maha Ashtami with Puspanjali. Devotees perform the ritualistic bathing and fasting before offering Puspanjali. Fresh flowers are held in hand and the mantra is recited after the priest. After reciting the Sanskrit couplets everyone showers flowers at the Goddess's feet.
